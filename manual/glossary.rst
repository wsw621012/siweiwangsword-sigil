   epubcheck
        A tool used to validate |epub| files. Since |epub| files need to follow the |epub| specification, this tool was made to check for basic errors in the file that would make it non-valid. Do note that it is not a panacea and it is not perfect; it doesn't check everything. Also note that even if ``epubcheck`` reports that a file is valid, that doesn't mean the file will render flawlessly on all *Reading Systems*. None of those are perfect either, and they all have their little quirks and idiosyncrasies.
        
        With all of that in mind, it's still a *very* good idea to make sure your |epub| files pass ``epubcheck`` without errors or warnings.
        
        ``Epubcheck`` can be downloaded `here <http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/>`_.
      
   Reading System
        Any combination of hardware and/or software that is used to present the |epub| book to the reader. For instance, it can be an application like *Adobe Digital Editions* or a hardware device like the *Barnes & Noble Nook*.
