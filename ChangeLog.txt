Sigil v0.1.6 2009.12.06.

    "ReportingIssues" wiki page on Sigil's website

    "Indent More" (issue #41)

    - TOC Editor now remembers its size across invocations and program launches

    - multiple images can now be inserted with the "Insert Image" dialog by selecting multiple images

    - the Save As dialog now uses the current filename in the filename field (issue #18)

    created after a chapter break to be displayed incorrectly (issue #78)

    properly appears after all images (issue #117)
    - added support for importing images referenced in SVG elements in HTML import
    - HTML importing now defaults to a locale-aware codec if one is not detected in the HTML stream;
    previously the fallback codec was UTF-8; this change should improve importing of old HTML
    documents (issue #113)

Sigil v0.1.3 2009.09.02.
    - implemented a work-around for a bug in Qt causing documents with "us-ascii" encoding

    - refactored HTML file import resource loading: should be a lot more robust now
    - fixed an issue with loading HTML files that reference the same images multiple times (issue #90)
    - implemented non-live View position synchronization; the Views are now synced

    to the same HTML element that held the caret in the first View (issue #8)
    - newlines are now removed from TOC headings to avoid rendering problems in ADE (issue #96)

    - book updates from TOC editor are now faster and have a much smaller memory overhead
    - fixed issue with removing headings from TOC in TOC editor (issue #88, part 2 and issue #21);
    also made TOC editor updates to headings MUCH more robust
    - all headings are now by default included in TOC... heuristics for "guessing" which
    headings the users wants have been removed (issue #88, part 1)
    - fixed critical issue with Sigil hanging when loading certain SGF files (issue #87)
    - fixed rare issue with duplicate image loading (issue #86)
    - implemented a workaround for a webkit bug causing the first character of a heading
    created after a chapter break to be displayed incorrectly (issue #78)
    - the "makedmg" target for Macs is not build by default anymore and needs to be

    - Macs now have a standard multiple document interface: opening a new file opens it
    in a new window, not in the old one (issue #22)

    time (issue #65)
    - loading of missing files in the recent files list is now improved (issue #57)

    OPS document is less than 1000 characters long (issue #48)
    - support for importing UTF-16 encoded documents (not just UTF-8)
