    - the Book Browser can now be opened/closed from the View menu (issue #335)
    - all the toolbars now have UI-facing names
    - by injecting a custom XML reader into QDom, the following issues were fixed:

    to determine if the epub has a cover image
    - if an epub has an image set as a cover image, Sigil will now write a special meta tag
    that identifies this image in the OPF; this tag is then used by the iPad (and Calibre)
    for the book cover, for instance
    - all OPF <guide> element information when loading epubs is now preserved

    inserts the old SGF horizontal rule chapter breaking marker and "Split On SGF Chapter Markers"
    which splits the current chapter according to the placement of these markers (issue #262)
    - chapter splitting now works in Code View
