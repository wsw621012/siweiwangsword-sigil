Sigil v0.1.4 <ADD DATE>
    - fixed syntax highlighting for XPGT stylesheets
    - fixed rare issue with SGF importing that displayed all body text underlined (issue #118)
    - fixed display of the Sigil chapter break in Book View: the red double-line now
    properly appears after all images (issue #117)
    - added support for importing images referenced in SVG elements in HTML import
    - HTML importing now defaults to a locale-aware codec if one is not detected in the HTML stream;
    previously the fallback codec was UTF-8; this change should improve importing of old HTML
    documents (issue #113)

Sigil v0.1.3 2009.09.02.
    - implemented a work-around for a bug in Qt causing documents with "us-ascii" encoding
    specified in the XML declaration to crash Sigil (issue #109)
    - resource path updating rewritten; should be more robust
    - fixed an issue where EPUB files from Google Books could not be opened (issue #106)
    - fixed regression for storing the folder from which the user last imported an image (issue #105)  
    - refactored HTML file import resource loading: should be a lot more robust now
    - fixed an issue with loading HTML files that reference the same images multiple times (issue #90)
    - implemented non-live View position synchronization; the Views are now synced
    by HTML element: moving the caret in one View will center the other View (upon switching)
    to the same HTML element that held the caret in the first View (issue #8)
    - newlines are now removed from TOC headings to avoid rendering problems in ADE (issue #96)
    - Sigil now creates a unique book identifier (if one is not provided by the user)
    using the UUID standard instead of a radnom sequence of characters and numbers;
    the old "SigilGEN" scheme is replaced with "UUID"
    - initial support for calibre interoperability (issue #94)
    - book updates from TOC editor are now faster and have a much smaller memory overhead
    - fixed issue with removing headings from TOC in TOC editor (issue #88, part 2 and issue #21);
    also made TOC editor updates to headings MUCH more robust
    - all headings are now by default included in TOC... heuristics for "guessing" which
    headings the users wants have been removed (issue #88, part 1)
    - fixed critical issue with Sigil hanging when loading certain SGF files (issue #87)
    - fixed rare issue with duplicate image loading (issue #86)
    - implemented a workaround for a webkit bug causing the first character of a heading
    created after a chapter break to be displayed incorrectly (issue #78)
    - the "makedmg" target for Macs is not build by default anymore and needs to be
    invoked directly; this was done to speed rebuilds
    - Macs now have a standard multiple document interface: opening a new file opens it
    in a new window, not in the old one (issue #22)
    - fixed a bug with warning dialog not informing the user of unsaved changes
    if he tried to load from the recent files list

    through the "CustomID" basic metadata property (issue #3)

    when editing in code view (issue #30)
    - Sigil is now a universal Mac application (ppc and i386, in 32bit) (issue #5)
    - implemented a workaround for a bug in QTextCodec causing bad HTML codec detection (issue #74)
    - SVG elements are not removed anymore (issue #24)
    - inter-document HTML links are now fully supported (issue #53)
    - fixed rare issue where CSS style rules could get duplicated when changing views
    - fixed issue with inline style tags in OPS documents not being loaded (issue #58)
    - Sigil can now accept a file to load as the first command line argument; this also
    provides support for "Open With..." operating system features (issue #63)
    - fixed an issue where the reported build time in the About dialog was actually the execution
    time (issue #65)
    - loading of missing files in the recent files list is now improved (issue #57)
    - fixed a rare issue where the wrong view could be sent to the printer on print actions
    - Sigil now creates a guide element with a cover page in the OPF if the content of the first
    OPS document is less than 1000 characters long (issue #48)
    - support for importing UTF-16 encoded documents (not just UTF-8)
    - provided install target for linux; the binary is now also named "sigil"
    (lower case 's') on Unix systems (except Mac) for the sake of convention (issue #46)
    - removed dependency on "data" directory (issue #51)

Sigil v0.1.1 2009.08.06.

    - fixed issue with loading images in HTML and EPUB docs that have regexp special characters
    in filenames. (issue #39)
